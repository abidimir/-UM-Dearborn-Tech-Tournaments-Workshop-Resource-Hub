    "### What is a branch?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **branch** is an independent line of development. Think of it like a parallel universe for your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "main:      A --- B --- C\n",
    "                  \\\n",
    "feature:           D --- E\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `main` branch has commits A, B, C\n",
    "- The `feature` branch splits off from B and has its own commits D, E\n",
    "- Changes in `feature` don't affect `main` until you merge them\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use branches?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Work on features without breaking the main code\n",
    "- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on different features simultaneously\n",
    "- **Experimentation**: Try something risky without consequences\n",
    "- **Organization**: Keep different types of work separate"
