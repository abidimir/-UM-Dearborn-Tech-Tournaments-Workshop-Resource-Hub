# Presenting Projects and Pitching

Building a great project is only half the battle — you also need to communicate it effectively. This section covers how to present technical projects to different audiences, from demo days to job interviews.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Structure a compelling project presentation
- Explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences
- Create effective slides and visuals
- Handle Q&A with confidence
- Tailor your pitch to different contexts (demo day, interview, stakeholder meeting)

## Why Presentation Skills Matter

Technical skills get you in the door, but communication skills determine how far you go.

**In school:**
- Capstone presentations
- Research symposiums
- Hackathon demos

**In your career:**
- Job interviews ("Tell me about a project you've worked on")
- Stakeholder updates
- Design reviews
- Conference talks

The ability to clearly explain your work is just as important as the work itself.

## The 3 Questions Every Presentation Must Answer

Before diving into slides, make sure you can clearly answer:

1. **What problem are you solving?**
   - Why does this matter?
   - Who has this problem?

2. **What did you build/do?**
   - High-level approach
   - Key technical decisions

3. **What were the results?**
   - Did it work?
   - What did you learn?

If your audience leaves understanding these three things, your presentation was successful.

## Know Your Audience

Different audiences need different presentations:

| Audience | They care about... | Adjust by... |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Technical peers** | Implementation details, code quality, architecture | Going deeper on technical choices |
| **Hiring managers** | Problem-solving process, collaboration, impact | Emphasizing your role and decisions |
| **Non-technical stakeholders** | Business value, results, timeline | Minimizing jargon, focusing on outcomes |
| **General audience (demo day)** | The "cool factor," clear explanation | Starting with the problem, showing demos |

**Rule of thumb:** When in doubt, go simpler. You can always add detail in Q&A.

---

## Storytelling Structure

The best technical presentations follow a narrative arc:

### 1. Hook (30 seconds)
Grab attention with a relatable problem, surprising fact, or quick demo.

*"Have you ever spent 20 minutes looking for parking? We built an app that predicts open spots in real-time."*

### 2. Problem (1-2 minutes)
Explain the problem in concrete terms. Make the audience feel the pain.

### 3. Solution (2-3 minutes)
Explain what you built. Use diagrams, demos, or screenshots — not just words.

### 4. How It Works (2-3 minutes)
Cover the technical approach at an appropriate level for your audience.

### 5. Results (1-2 minutes)
Share outcomes: metrics, user feedback, lessons learned.

### 6. Conclusion (30 seconds)
Summarize key takeaways. End strong.

## Live Demo Tips

Demos are powerful but risky. Follow these rules:

### Do:
- **Have a backup** — Screenshots or video recording in case something breaks
- **Practice the exact flow** — Know exactly what you'll click and type
- **Use realistic data** — Fake data that looks real, not "test123"
- **Keep it short** — 1-2 minutes max; show the highlights
- **Narrate what you're doing** — "Now I'm going to submit this form..."

### Don't:
- **Rely on live internet** — Have offline backups if possible
- **Type passwords on screen** — Use environment variables or pre-logged-in sessions
- **Show error messages** — Unless that's part of the demo
- **Ad-lib the demo** — Follow a script

### The "Demo Gods" Backup Plan

Technology fails at the worst times. Always have:
1. A video recording of the demo working
2. Screenshots of key screens
3. A verbal description ready ("Let me walk you through what would happen...")

## Slide Design Principles

### Less is More

| Bad Slide | Good Slide |
|-----------|------------|
| 8 bullet points with full sentences | 3 bullet points with key phrases |
| Tiny font to fit everything | Large font, one idea per slide |
| No visuals | Diagram, screenshot, or image |
| Reading your slides aloud | Slides support what you're saying |

### Visual Hierarchy

- **Title:** What this slide is about
- **Key point:** One main takeaway
- **Supporting content:** Details that reinforce the key point

### The 10-Second Rule

If someone can't understand your slide in 10 seconds, it's too complex.

## Handling Q&A

### Preparation

Anticipate questions in these categories:
- **Clarification:** "Can you explain X again?"
- **Deep dive:** "How did you handle Y?"
- **Challenge:** "Why didn't you do Z instead?"
- **Scope:** "What's next? What would you do differently?"

### During Q&A

1. **Listen fully** — Don't interrupt or assume the question
2. **Pause before answering** — It's okay to think
3. **Repeat/rephrase** — "So you're asking about..." (buys time and ensures understanding)
4. **Be honest** — "I don't know" or "We didn't get to that" is fine
5. **Stay concise** — Answer the question, then stop

### Difficult Questions

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| You don't know the answer | "That's a great question — I'd need to look into that further." |
| The question is off-topic | "That's interesting — let's discuss that after. For now..." |
| The question challenges your approach | "That's a valid point. We considered X, but chose Y because..." |
| The person keeps asking follow-ups | "Let's take this offline so others can ask questions too." |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting with technical details** — Lead with the problem, not the solution
2. **Too much jargon** — Define terms or use analogies
3. **No demo or visuals** — Show, don't just tell
4. **Running over time** — Practice with a timer
5. **Reading slides verbatim** — Slides are prompts, not scripts
6. **Apologizing unnecessarily** — "This is just a small project..." undermines your work
7. **Skipping the "why"** — Always explain why your project matters

---

## Practice Makes Perfect

### Before Your Presentation

1. **Practice out loud** — Thinking through it isn't the same as saying it
2. **Record yourself** — Watch for filler words, pacing, eye contact
3. **Practice with a timer** — Stay within your time limit
4. **Get feedback** — Present to friends or teammates first
5. **Practice Q&A** — Have someone ask you tough questions

### The Day Of

1. **Arrive early** — Test your setup (display, audio, internet)
2. **Have backups** — Slides on USB, demo recorded, etc.
3. **Take a breath** — Nervousness is normal; pause before you start
4. **Make eye contact** — Look at different parts of the audience
5. **Speak slowly** — You're probably going faster than you think

---

## Suggested Learning Path

1. **Read the Pitch Deck Template** — Understand the structure
2. **Review the Example Project Summary** — See how to write about your project
3. **Use the Demo Day Checklist** — Prepare your presentation
4. **Review the Rubric** — Know how you'll be evaluated
5. **Practice, practice, practice**

## Final Thoughts

Presenting your work is a skill that improves with practice. Every presentation is an opportunity to get better. Don't aim for perfection — aim for clarity.

Your project is worth sharing. Go tell people about it.
